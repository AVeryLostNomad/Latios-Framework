    template

## [0.2.1] - 2020-10-31

    `LatiosInitializationSystemGroup` after bootstrap is no longer supported

### Fixed

## [0.2.0] - 2020-9-22

Officially supports Entities [0.14.0]

### Added

-   New Feature: Burst Patcher uses codegen at Build time to allow for
    compilation of generic jobs scheduled by generic methods even if the generic
    argument or the job is private

-   Added "Bootstrap - Explicit Workflow" creation tool

-   Added `BootstrapTools.InjectUnitySystems` which does exactly what it sounds
    like

-   Added `BootstrapTools.UpdatePlayerLoopWithDelayedSimulation` which runs
    `SimulationSystemGroup` after rendering

-   New Feature: Collection component dependency management now hooks into the
    `Dependency` field that lambda jobs use

-   New Feature: Fluent Queries provide a fluent extendible shorthand for
    generating EntityQuery instances

-   Added `LatiosSimulationSystemGroup` and `LatiosPresentationSystemGroup`

-   Added `IManagedComponent` and `ICollectionComponent` API to `ManagedEntity`

-   Added float2 variants for `SmoothStart` and `SmoothStop` in `LatiosMath`

### Changed

-   The original Bootstrap creation is now labeled "Bootstrap - Injection
    Workflow"

-   Renamed `IComponent` to `IManagedComponent`

-   `IManagedComponent` and `ICollectionComponent` behave differently due to
    DOTS evolution. See the documentation for how to use them.

-   `FixedString` is used instead of `NativeString`

-   `BootstrapTools.UpdatePlayerLoopWithFixedUpdate` is now
    `BootstrapTools.AddWorldToCurrentPlayerLoopWithFixedUpdate` with updated API
    to mirror `ScriptBehaviorUpdateOrder`

-   `EntityDataCopyKit` now ignores collection components by default

-   `SubSystem` now subclasses `SystemBase` and should be used for all logical
    systems

-   `LatiosInitializationSystemGroup` was reworked for compatibility with the
    latest Entities

### Removed

-   `JobSubSystem` - use `SubSystem` instead which now subclasses `SystemBase`

### Fixed

-   Fixed an issue with `EntityDataCopyKit` and dynamic buffers

-   `SuperSystem` and `RootSuperSystem` should now properly invoke
    `OnStopRunning` of children systems on failure of `ShouldUpdateSystem`

-   Fixed `IManagedComponent` and `ICollectionComponent` reactive systems not
    reacting aside from the first and last frames of a scene

-   `SceneManagerSystem` now properly removes `RequestLoadScene` components
    after processing them

### Improved

-   Many exceptions are now wrapped in a
    `[Conditional("ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTION_CHECKS")]`

-   Entity destruction on scene changes now works immediately instead of delayed
    unload

## [0.1.0] - 2019-12-21

### This is the first release of *Latios Core for DOTS*.
